## Additional libraries
### Mixins
Mixins can be used to modify classes at runtime before they are loaded. LiquidBounce+ is using it to inject its code into the Minecraft client. This way, we do not have to ship Mojang's copyrighted code. If you want to learn more about it, check out its [Documentation](https://docs.spongepowered.org/5.1.0/en/plugin/internals/mixins.html).

## Contributing

We appreciate contributions. So if you want to support us, feel free to make changes to LiquidBounce+'s source code and submit a pull request. Currently, our main goals are the following:
1. Improve LiquidBounce+'s performance.
2. Re-work most of the render code.

If you have experience in one or more of these fields, we would highly appreciate your support.
